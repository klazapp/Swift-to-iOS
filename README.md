# SwiftToiOSPostBuilder for Unity

## Introduction
`SwiftToiOSPostBuilder` is a Unity editor script designed for iOS builds, facilitating the integration of Swift into Unity-generated Xcode projects. This automation ensures correct configuration of Swift modules and public headers in the Unity Framework target of Xcode projects.

## Features
- Automated setup of Swift integration in Xcode projects generated by Unity.
- Adds necessary build properties and public headers to the Unity Framework target.
- Streamlines Swift usage in Unity iOS projects.

## Requirements
- Unity Editor with iOS build support.
- An iOS project generated from Unity for Swift integration.

To install `SwiftToiOSPostBuilder` via Unity's Package Manager:

1. **Open Unity Package Manager**:
   - In Unity, go to `Window` > `Package Manager`.

2. **Add Package from Git URL**:
   - In the Package Manager, click the `+` icon at the top left corner and select `Add package from git URL...`.

## Usage
After installation:

1. **Build Your iOS Project**:
