# SwiftToiOSPostBuilder for Unity

## Introduction
`SwiftToiOSPostBuilder` is a Unity editor script designed for iOS builds. It automates the process of setting up Swift to Unity integration in Xcode projects generated by Unity. This script ensures that the necessary Swift modules and public headers are correctly configured in the Unity Framework target of your Xcode project.

## Features
- Automatically sets up Swift integration in Unity-generated Xcode projects.
- Adds necessary build properties and public headers to the Unity Framework target.
- Simplifies the process of using Swift in Unity iOS projects.

## Requirements
- Unity Editor with iOS build support.
- An iOS project built from Unity that you want to integrate with Swift.

## Usage
To use `SwiftToiOSPostBuilder` in your Unity iOS project:

1. **Add the Script to Your Project**:
   - Place the `SwiftToiOSPostBuilder.cs` script in an Editor folder within your Unity project.

2. **Build Your iOS Project**:
   - Perform an iOS build from Unity as you normally would.
   - The script runs automatically as a post-build process when building for iOS.

3. **Check the Xcode Project**:
   - After the build is complete, open the generated Xcode project.
   - Verify that the necessary Swift modules and public headers are set up correctly in the Unity Framework target.

## Note
- This script is only active for iOS builds (`BuildTarget.iOS`) and when the Unity Editor is being used.
- Ensure that the paths to the module map file and public headers in the script match the structure of your Unity project.
